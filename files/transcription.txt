Chapter 1

Introduction and Overview

The course covers two main topics: game theory and mechanism design. We begin by introducing the
fundamental concepts and topics in game theory and will then apply these to topics in mechanism
design.

1.1 Game Theory

Game theory is a method for analyzing strategic interactions. We consider a situation to be strategic
whenever the consequences of a choice by one individual depend not only on the individual’s behavior
alone but also on the behavior of other individuals. For example, suppose that Apple introduces a
new iPhone and considers the price it will charge for it. Clearly, the demand for the new iPhone
will depend on the price chosen by Apple—however, if we reasonably assume that the latest Samsung
Galaxy is, at least to some extent, comparable to the new iPhone, then the two are substitutes, and
the demand for the iPhone will also depend on the price chosen by Samsung for the latest Samsung
Galaxy. Pricing a product in a market with few competitors (a so-called oligopoly) is a situation of
strategic interaction that we can study with the tools of game theory. Notice that, in contrast, the
pricing decision of a monopolist is not a strategic situation: A monopolist does not face competition
and therefore solves a decision-theoretic rather than a game-theoretic problem.

1.1.1 Examples

There are many applications of game theory from a wide range of ﬁelds and topics.

1. How should two presidential candidates design their political agenda to maximize their chances

of being elected?

2. A pedestrian wants to cross a street and a driver wants to drive through the crossing. Should
the pedestrian wait for the car to pass or should the pedestrian cross the street? How should the
driver of the car behave?

3. How should a football player decide where to kick the penalty? How does the goalie decide in

which direction to jump?

4. Generative adversarial networks are inspired by the theory of zero-sum games: a generator
generates new artiﬁcial examples (for example, fake photographs of celebrities) with the aim of
fooling a discriminator. The discriminator attempts to distinguish generator-generated examples
from real examples (for example, actual photographs of celebrities).

Chapter 1. Introduction and Overview

In the chapters on game theory, we will learn to describe such real-world situations as games using
mathematical models. Based on this modeling, we will introduce concepts that allow us to understand
individuals’ behavior in games given an economic environment; that is, given the rules of the games.

1.1.2 Di↵erent Classes of Games

The tools of game theory have been applied to a variety of di↵erent strategic interactions. Depending
on the context of the environment to be analyzed, di↵erent features of the strategic situation must be
taken into account. The following is a broad overview of distinctions in the modeling framework.

Cooperative and Noncooperative Games. Game theory broadly consists of two main branches:
cooperative and non-cooperative game theory. As the name suggests, the distinction is in the nature of
the decision-making process of the players. In cooperative game theory, players can engage in binding
pre-game agreements. That is, players can “sit together” before taking their actions in the actual game
to be played and write a contract that they can enforce in court, specifying how they will behave in
the game. As that contract is enforceable, the players will follow their agreement.

Why would players want to write such agreements? Such agreements can be beneﬁcial because
they may prevent bad outcomes that arise due to individual incentives to take di↵erent actions. For
example, consider the decision of two countries whether to build nuclear weapons. If the presidents
of the two countries can sign a binding agreement that they will never build such a nuclear weapon,
there will be a nuclear-weapon-free world. If, however, such an agreement is not possible, it may be
optimal, in a non-cooperative game, for each of the countries individually to build a nuclear weapon:
If the other country has none, having one may help exert power over that country. If the other country
has one, having one may help defend your interests viz-a-viz that country. Both countries might end
up having nuclear weapons—although they would have preferred not to build one, all else equal.

The focus of our class and these notes will be on non-cooperative games. However, even in non-
cooperative games, players might engage in similar cooperative agreements. To include this possibility,
the negotiation process leading up to such agreements also has to be explicitly modeled.

Static and Multistage Games. One important decision when modeling a strategic situation is the
timeline of the interaction and the sequence in which participants act. For example, when visiting a
local bar as a tourist, it is likely that the barkeeper recognizes you as such. Therefore, the mutual
understanding will be that your interaction is only of short duration (and probably even a one-time
interaction only). In contrast, if you are a local visiting the same bar, the barkeeper may recognize
you as a local. In this case, it is more likely that you will come back. In particular, you can condition
your choice of returning to the bar based on the quality of the drinks and the service.

The preceding example illustrates the distinction between one-time interactions and more dynamic,
repeated strategic situations. However, beyond this distinction, even a one-time interaction may be of
a more dynamic nature. For example, as a tourist visiting a bar only once, you can decide how much
to tip depending on the quality of the service in the bar. Such a setting is not static: the barkeeper
ﬁrst decides how friendly to be or how much e↵ort to put into mixing a high-quality drink for you.
Only after learning about the barkeeper’s behavior do you decide on the tip, and, in particular, you
may tip di↵erently depending on the barkeeper’s behavior.

In other settings, the interaction may be simultaneous in nature. For example, consider two inno-
vative pharmaceutical companies. Research on novel drugs is usually highly secretive, as ﬁrms want to
ensure that competitors cannot free-ride on insights previous internal research has delivered. There-
fore, when deciding on the focus of R&D spending in the current year, managers of di↵erent ﬁrms
act without knowing what the other ﬁrms focus on. Hence, the ﬁrms act simultaneously: they cannot
condition their choice on other ﬁrms’ choices. Note that this is even true if the decisions do not happen
literally simultaneously. The crucial point is that these decisions occur without knowing what other
ﬁrms decided.

2

Chapter 1. Introduction and Overview

Is the choice of the R&D focus a static or a multistage game? That depends.

If we think of
pharmaceutical ﬁrms as long-lived entities competing with a similar set of ﬁrms year after year, then
we should model their choices as a multistage game, where, in each stage (e.g., year), the ﬁrms
If we think of them as short-lived or as
simultaneously choose the focus of their research e↵orts.
competing with di↵erent ﬁrms year after year, then we can model their choices as a static game (that
is, a one-time interaction with simultaneous moves).

A simpler example of a static game can be the occasional Rock-Paper-Scissors game that you play
with your roommates to decide who does the dishes or at the beginning of a friendly soccer match
to decide on the kicko↵. Usually, there is a negligible dynamic component to such games, and by
deﬁnition, players act simultaneously in that game.

Perfect and Imperfect Information Games. Another crucial feature of strategic situations is
the information available to players when making their decisions. In a game of perfect information,
a player can observe the past moves of all other players. Chess, for example, is a perfect information
game. Scotland Yard, in contrast, is a game of imperfect information, as some players cannot observe
the moves of other players.

Complete and Incomplete Information Games.
In a game of complete information, players
have access to all the relevant information about the game. For example, in chess, a player knows
which actions the other player has available and that the other player does not want to lose the game.
However, in many other real-world strategic situations, a player might not know what other players
aim for or other relevant pieces of information.

Poker is an example of an incomplete information game. Players do not know their opponent’s
hand. Hence, they are uncertain about the consequences of their actions. Similarly, a buyer of a good
might not know whether the good is of high or low quality.

We will see later in the class that there is an elegant way to establish a close conceptual connection
between imperfect and incomplete information games, which allows us to study them with the same
tools.

1.2 Mechanism Design

Mechanism design, on the contrary, uses game theory as input and assumes that individuals behave in
strategic situations according to the concepts of game theory. Based on this hypothesis, mechanism
design aims to answer questions about the optimal design of a game to achieve a particular objective
with limited information. For example, suppose that a seller wishes to sell an object for the highest
possible revenue. Should the seller put the object with a price tag into a store and the ﬁrst buyer
willing to pay the price receives the object? Or should the seller rather run an auction to sell the
object? In this sense, mechanism design can be viewed as reverse game theory: there is an institution
that wants to achieve an objective (for example, sell an object at the highest possible revenue), and
to achieve this objective, the institution designs a game played among individual agents (for example,
potential buyers of an object). Then, given the behavior of the agents in the games, the institution
optimizes the rules of the game so that it achieves its objective.

1.2.1 Examples

Similar to game theory, mechanism design has been applied in many di↵erent contexts and ﬁelds.

1. How should a country design its presidential election? Should citizens vote for a single candidate,

or should citizens be asked for a ranking of the candidates?

2. How does the tra c law optimally punish pedestrians and car drivers after a crash? Should there

be pedestrian crossings and tra c lights?

3

Chapter 1. Introduction and Overview

3. Should the consequences of illegally preventing a last-minute goal in soccer be more severe than

a penalty and a red card (for example, by assigning a goal to the team and a red card)?

4. What is the optimal way to reduce carbon emissions? By introducing a carbon tax or by designing

a market for emissions?

5. How should organ donations be allocated to patients to maximize the number of lives saved?

In this part of the course, we will introduce the fundamental concepts of mechanism design required
for studying such questions about the optimal design of environments to achieve the desired objectives.

Representation of Static Games

The simplest class of games are static games, that is, strategic situations in which all players of the
game act simultaneously and only once. Consequently, in a static game, a player cannot observe the
actions of other players and can, therefore, not react to others’ actions or inﬂuence others with their
own actions.
In this chapter, we will narrow our focus even further and assume that players have
access to all information that is relevant to the strategic situation—that is, we focus on static games
of complete information. We will be more precise about what we mean by this as we go along.

In the ﬁrst step, we introduce a formal representation of static games. In particular, we want to
understand which components of the strategic situation we have to incorporate into our model to be
able to discuss with the tools of game theory. In the second step, we will treat the strategic situation
as a decision problem to understand which outcomes of the game can be expected with minimal
restrictions on the players’ decision-making process beyond rationality.

Example 1. Consider the following simple example of a strategic interaction (the grade game) between
two classmates: Ann and Bob. Ann and Bob individually contemplate whether to collaborate in the
preparation for a game theory exam. Whenever both cooperate, they share their class notes and
knowledge with each other and will write a good exam; say, their ﬁnal grade will be a 29. However, if
they both decide not to cooperate, they will be less well prepared and each receives a grade of 28. In
the case that one of them shares his/her notes and knowledge, but the other one does not, then the
one who did not cooperate will have a lot of knowledge and will do relatively better than the other one
leading to a grade of 30L. The player who cooperated does not beneﬁt from the other one’s knowledge
and only gets a grade of 27.

Ann, Bob

include the set of players that are involved in the game.

How can we describe this situation as a game? First, a formal description of a game has to

In this case, the possible outcomes are a grade for each of the classmates, y
Fourth, a game description requires a mapping from action proﬁles—that is, the vector of actions taken
by each player—into outcomes. In the grade game, the outcome function is

g(aAnn, aBob) = 8

>>>:

1We let the ﬁrst entry in each outcome denote Ann’s and the second entry Bob’s grade.

Fifth, we need to assign preferences over outcomes for each player. We assume for now that players
care only about their own grades and that they prefer better grades. For example, we could assume

We often represent games with few players and few actions in a matrix as in Table 3.3.2 Rows
correspond to actions by the “row player”; that is, Ann in this case. Columns correspond to actions by
the “column player”; that is, Bob in this case. Each entry of the matrix then corresponds to a realized
action proﬁle. The ﬁrst number indicates the payo↵ of the row player given the realized action proﬁle,
the second number indicates the payo↵ of the column player given the realized action proﬁle.

Table 2.1: The grade game represented in a game matrix.

Example 1 suggests that a complete description of a static game with complete information requires:

A description of

1. the participants in the game;

2. what each participant can do;

3. what are the possible outcomes of the strategic situation;

4. how the actions a↵ect the potential outcomes;

5. how the participants evaluate the di↵erent outcomes.

The next section formalizes this description.

2.1 Formal Representation of Static Games

We now deﬁne the ﬁrst formal representation of static games with complete information.3 We will
simplify this deﬁnition in the next step.

frequently during the class.

3Note that this representation is often denoted as the normal form or strategic form representation of a game. We

will come back to this notion later.

over action proﬁles instead of over outcomes that are determined by the action proﬁles. For stochastic
outcome functions, preferences are deﬁned over lotteries. For a deﬁnition of lotteries and probability
measures over ﬁnite domains, see Appendix A.

In this class, most of our examples fall into one of two classes of games, ﬁnite and compact-

continuous games. We deﬁne these classes in the following two deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 2.3. A static game G is ﬁnite if, for all players i

I, the action set Ai is ﬁnite.

The following is an example of a compact-continuous game that is a classical economic example,
which we will return to frequently. Notably, this game is one of the earliest games that have been
studied with game-theoretic concepts by Augustin Cournot in Cournot (1838) long before game theory
had been established as a research ﬁeld.

Example 2. Consider the following game of two ﬁrms, I =

Justiﬁability and Dominance

In the next step, we aim to understand which actions a rational player may choose in a game. Towards
this, we ﬁrst take on the perspective of decision theory; that is, we ignore the potentially complicated
strategic reasoning a player might engage in. We present the results and concepts in this section almost
exclusively for ﬁnite games. However, with one exception (Lemma 3.4) all concepts and results also
apply to compact-continuous games and you can use them in those instances as well.

We ﬁrst introduce some basic deﬁnitions and then illustrate how we can apply them to reason

about behavior in games in the simplest possible form.

Conjectures. We represent with a conjecture the behavior that a player expects from other players.
For now, we will not discuss how conjectures are obtained and instead take them as given. Later on,
we will take a closer look at the formation of conjectures. Formally, we deﬁne a conjecture as follows.

Note that this deﬁnition allows players to hold probabilistic conjectures; that is, a player can expect
other players to randomize over their actions. Further, note that we can deﬁne the set of deterministic
conjectures as those conjectures that assign probability one to a particular action proﬁle (that is,
i).1 Hence, we can think of the set of other players’ action proﬁles as a

Mixed Actions. A player can randomize over her available actions. We call such a randomization
a mixed action. We assume that the random draws from players’ mixed actions are statistically
independent. That is, in a simultaneous move game, there is no way in which players can correlate
their draws. We will discuss correlated behavior in a separate chapter on correlated equilibrium.

suppose that Ann chooses to play all actions with an equal probability, while Bob randomizes only

↵A(Scissors) = 1/3 and ↵B(Rock) = ↵B(P aper) = 1/2 and ↵B(Scissors) = 0. This yields for Ann’s

Illustration: Penalty Shooting. Suppose that a goalkeeper and a striker play the game represented
in Table 3.2.
In such a game with only two actions for the other player, it is straightforward to
represent the payo↵s graphically as illustrated in Figure 3.1. The horizontal axis represents the striker’s
conjectures and each line in the graph the expected payo↵ from an action given the conjecture. Shooting
the penalty to the left is a best reply to conjecture µi whenever µi(Lef t)
1/2; that is, whenever the
striker expects the goalie to jump to the left with no more than 50% probability, shooting to the left
maximizes the striker’s expected utility. Similarly, whenever the striker expects the goalie to jump to
the right with no more than 50% probability, shooting to the right is a best reply to such conjectures.
Thus, both Left and Right are justiﬁable actions for the striker. However, Middle is not justiﬁable
because it is never a best reply for the striker for any conjecture µi.



In the following lemma, we show that if a player i has a mixed best reply, then she can always
maximize her expected payo↵ with a pure action as well. This result is useful to keep in mind. There
are instances, in which we might consider mixing by players unrealistic; in those instances, it is helpful
to remember that randomization is not necessary to maximize expected utility.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that if the mixed action is a best reply, then every pure action in its support
must be a best reply as well. We prove this statement using its contrapositive:3 If some pure action
in the support of a mixed action is not a best reply, then the mixed action cannot be a best reply.

Let a⇤i be a pure action chosen with positive probability in the mixed action ↵⇤i and suppose
that there is a mixed action ↵i for player i inducing a higher expected utility for player i; that is,
ui(↵i, µi) > ui(a⇤i , µi). Hence, a⇤i is a pure action in the support of ↵⇤i and not a best reply.

Given that the expected utility of any mixed action is a weighted average of the expected utility from
Ai such that ui(a0i, µi) >
all of i’s pure actions,
ui(a⇤i , µi). We can now construct a mixed action ↵0i that yields a higher expected utility than ↵⇤i
showing that ↵⇤i is not a best reply to conjecture µi.

Based on the previous lemma, we show next that, for any conjecture µi, a best reply exists for

µi.

Proof. Observe that the expected utility of player i given conjecture µi

Making use of the best-reply correspondence, we can now deﬁne the set of justiﬁable actions for

the set of justiﬁable actions is the image set of the best-reply correspondence,

Going back to the grade game in Example 1, we see that Cooperate is not justiﬁable for both
players. There is no conjecture about the other player’s actions: Don’t Cooperate yields a higher
payo↵ for any choice of the other classmate. Using justiﬁability, we can conclude that a rational player
should only play Don’t Cooperate in this game.

 

For the penalty shooting game in Table 3.2, we see that both Left and Right are justiﬁable for
the striker. Middle, however, is not justiﬁable as is evident from Figure 3.1. For any conjecture, the
striker can do better by choosing Left or Right than by choosing Middle.

3.2 Dominated Actions

We saw that to determine the set of justiﬁable actions for a player, we had to check for each action
whether there exists a conjecture such that it becomes a best reply to this conjecture. However, it
turns out that there is a simpler approach to determining justiﬁable actions. Towards this, we deﬁne
the concept of dominance.

Deﬁnition 3.6. A mixed action ↵i 2
yields a strictly higher payo↵ irrespective of the choices of the other players; that is, for all a

(3.22)

We call an action a⇤i dominant if all other pure actions are dominated by it.

It turns out that we can prove that the set of actions that are not dominated coincides with the
set of justiﬁable actions as we show in the next lemma. This result establishes that a rational player
will not play a dominated action.

Chapter 3. Justiﬁability and Dominance

The two main takeaways are that a rational player will never choose a dominated action and that
each undominated action is justiﬁable as a best reply to some belief. Going back to Example 1, it can be
deduced that Cooperate is dominated by Don’t Cooperate, so neither Ann nor Bob will choose to Coop-
erate in the game. There is a unique action justiﬁable action proﬁle: (Don0t Cooperate, Don0t Cooperate).
However, if we slightly change the payo↵s induced by the action proﬁle (D, C) from (3,-1) to (-3,-1)
and the payo↵s induced by the action proﬁle (C, D) from (-1, 3) to (-1, -3), none of the actions is
dominated since when one of the two players chooses Cooperate, the best reply for the other player
is Cooperate while when one of the two players chooses Don’t Cooperate, the best reply for the other
player is Don’t Cooperate.

3.3 Cautious Players and Weakly Dominated Actions

In the previous section, we have seen that a rational player will only choose actions that are not
dominated. Sometimes, an action for such a rational player may be justiﬁed by a conjecture that rules
out a particular action proﬁle of other players entirely. This may be too knife-edge for a cautious player
who worries that the other players might make mistakes when choosing their actions or that there is
some other uncertainty involving the other players’ choices. This leads us to the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 3.7. A player i is cautious if her conjecture does not rule out any action proﬁle a

Chapter 3. Justiﬁability and Dominance

It will turn out that the set of justiﬁable actions for a cautious player is a subset of the set of
justiﬁable actions for a non-cautious player. The reason is that a cautious player can rationalize fewer
actions as she can hold strictly fewer conjectures than a non-cautious player. Thus, she can justify
actions with fewer conjectures. However, we can deﬁne a slightly modiﬁed concept of domination, to
obtain a similar insight about the set of justiﬁable actions.

Interested buyers have a valuation vi > 0 for the artwork and write a bid into
the following way.
a sealed envelope and hand it to the auctioneer. The auctioneer opens the envelopes and the buyer
who wrote down the highest bid receives the artwork and has to pay the highest bid submitted by all
other interested buyers. In case of a tie, the auctioneer randomizes uniformly among the buyers who
submitted the highest bid.8

left as an exercise.

Consider the case ai > vi.

7For compact-continuous games, it holds that ri( c(A

vi instead of ai.

It follows that by bidding vi, i receives a payo↵ that is always at least as high as when bidding ai > vi
and in some instances her payo↵ is strictly higher.
